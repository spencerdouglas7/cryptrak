A full stack web development project which I completed independently as a passion project. As a user, you can browse real-time cryptocurrency price data, create a watchlist of your favorite currencies, and add purchases/sales of specific tokens to build and track a portfolio. Built with Angular, Python (Beautiful Soup & Flask), TypeScript/JavaScript, SQL instance via Google Cloud, and HTML/CSS.
